## Anti-Spoofing Face Recognition
This project focuses on an approach to detect a
human face using texture analysis which includes computing
Histogram of Gradients over a region of face and then uses
Support Vector Machines to recognize a face. A blink
detection mechanism used in this paper ensures the liveliness
of the person, making the system more reliable. A Raspberry
Pi module is used in implementing the work involved in this
paper and the programming is done in Python using libraries
like opencv and numpy.
